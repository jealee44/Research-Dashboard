## Project Description

The Spinal Surgery Outcomes Dashboard is an interactive web application designed to visualize and analyze data from spinal surgery studies. The dashboard is built using Streamlit and integrates Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for data manipulation and visualization.

## Features

- Display and analyze spinal surgery data
- Visualize revision rates, time to revision, PI-LL mismatch correction, ODI improvement, and VAS improvement
- Interactive navigation between different datasets
- Clean and user-friendly interface

## Usage

1. Run the Streamlit app:

    ```sh
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

2. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8501` to view the dashboard.
